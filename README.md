- 👋 Hi, I’m @RayAdLibitum
- 👀 I’m interested in web dev, sound engineering, music and videogames. Also profits
- 🌱 I’m currently learning literally everything because it's a new job and I'm taking a degree at night
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I'm too busy
- 📫 How to reach me: don't. Just kidding, send me a message in here or something
